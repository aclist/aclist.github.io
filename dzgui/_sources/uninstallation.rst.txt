Uninstallation
==================

To uninstall DZGUI and its associated files, invoke ``./dzgui.sh`` with the ``-u`` or ``--uninstall`` flag.

Follow the prompts to choose from:

- **Full uninstall** -- removes the application and all user-defined configuration files
- **Partial uninstall** -- removes the application, but keeps user-defined configuration files

.. tip::
    If you intend to reinstall DZGUI again, keeping your configuration files is recommended.
